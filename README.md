 #  EXPERIMENT 7 CloudSim Multi-Datacenter Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **CloudSim 3.0.3 simulation** where two users submit cloudlets that are executed across **two separate datacenters**. Each datacenter contains one host, and tasks are scheduled through a broker that distributes workloads to virtual machines.

This experiment illustrates **multi-datacenter architecture, user-level task scheduling, and distributed cloud execution behavior**.

---

## Aim
To create **two datacenters with one host each** and execute cloudlets from **two users** to analyze distributed execution behavior.

---

## Objectives
- Simulate multiple datacenters in CloudSim
- Configure hosts and allocate resources
- Simulate multiple users submitting tasks
- Create virtual machines for execution
- Analyze distributed execution results
